# Global Temperatures Chart :foggy:	

## What is this project? :bulb:

This threshold graph shows the evolution of global temperatures for the last three centuries. The mean monthly temperature and the variation from the data mean can be checked by moving the pointer over each piece of data. It uses D3.js and SASS.
